// here is the beginning of my awesome code!!!
console.log ('Quiz.js page is good to go!')

function populatePage (inventory) {
  // Loop over the inventory and populate the page





  // Now that the DOM is loaded, establish all the event listeners needed
  CarLot.activateEvents();






}

// Load the inventory and send a callback function to be
// invoked after the process is complete
CarLot.loadInventory();
